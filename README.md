# iTheon-PDA-Taskboard v1.0.2

This mod adds a new taskboard tab to the PDA where you can accept all the dynamic tasks remotely

How to use it? <br>
On Taskboard tab there's a Refresh tasks button - click it once and wait for the tasks to be processed (time depends on the population density in radius, but is pretty fast). <br>
You'll get a list of tasks split into categories. Next to the task description you will see two buttons. Accept task - self-explanatory - accepting a task automatically refreshes the board, as some tasks automatically remove others from the available list (vanilla Anomaly stuff). Next task - tells PDA to prepare info about the next task in category.


Possible questions: <br>
Q: Why there's no `Previous task` button? <br>
A: In short - engine limitation. It's because of problems with getting additional info about the task (middle column). To add such a button, I'd need to modify a lot of base game files and this would lead to many compatibility issues with other mods.

Q: Why I can take delivery and measure tasks remotely? They give me some items <br>
A: I wanted to add a screen blackout for those tasks, but it's annoying. I think it's better without it. You can omit those tasks if it hurts your realism

Q: Some task details are messed up and are showing next to the wrong task. Why? <br>
A: This bug should be eradicated by now. If you still encounter it, please report to me. EDIT: Sadly - it's not eradicated. The performance improvements achieved through refactoring caused some new issues with asynchronous events. I'll be looking into this later. For now you can be sure that task category, task giver and long description are ALWAYS right - the task details paired with them might be wrong because of async events happening in wrong order.

Q: One of my tasks has no image. Why? <br>
A: Some tasks don't have image - no worries.

Q: Does it work with WTF? <br>
A: Technically yes, but some people report random issues. You should report those problems either to me or to Igi.

Q: Some `Search stash` or `Drug runner` tasks appear in `Bounty tasks` category. Is that a bug? <br>
A: Yes - but it's a bug in vanilla Anomaly files. These tasks need to be categorized as `Bounty tasks` because their setup function dispatches a delayed function to a wrong queue (the bounty task queue). This causes some task details to be lost if a bugged task like this is processed simultaneously with a normal bounty task.

Q: Why you didn't make one full board of tasks? <br>
A: Engine limitation. I've tried doing it in several different ways, but there needs to be a delay between fetching detailed info about tasks of similar type. With no delay, specific info about the task (e. g. target name and location) will not load properly. You could accept such a task, but you wouldn't know who exactly you have to kill and where he is before you accept it. With full list - even when I've set certain delays to 10 seconds - it sometimes happened anyway. With split list, there doesn't need to be any delay.
